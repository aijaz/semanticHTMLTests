            <p>
                This website is for teachers, mentors, advisers, and anyone else who wants to let others know whether or not right now is a good time to contact them.

            <header><h3>The problem it solves</h3></header>
            <p>
                There are times when we're involved in what I call "low-value tasks" like, watching TV, surfing the net, or simply puttering around the house.
                At these times we're willing to be interrupted by others. Often, our students or advisees won't reach out to us because they don't know that we're available.
                This website solves that problem.

                Pick a user name. Create an account. Sign in and flip the switch to indicate your availability.
                Share your link with others. That's it!

            <p>
                Our site is fully compatible with modern smartphones. Our iOS app (coming soon) provides widgets so that you can change your availability from your home screen.

               <p>
                       I don't want your personal data. I only ask for your email because it's the best way to deal with
                       forgotten passwords. In fact, I would recommend that you use a throwaway email address when signing up
                       for this service. Since we don't gather (and sell) your data, you are not the product here. This service is.
                       I'm doing this the old-fashioned way: I provide a service, you pay for it, and your personal information
                       is safe. :)
               </p>
               <p>
                       Most user names are $1/month, or $9/year. If a user name is only 2 letters long, it's $2/month or $18/year.
                       Single-letter user names are $4/month, or $36/year.
